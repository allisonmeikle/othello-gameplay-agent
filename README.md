# McGill University, COMP 424
Engineered an Othello gameplay agent in Python using Monte Carlo Tree Search in student_agent.py, incorporating exploration-exploitation balancing (UCB1) and optimization for efficient simulations; evaluated performance against baseline agents and refined for strategic depth. The project includes a full simulation environment to visualize games, autoplay multiple matchups, and evaluate agents across dynamic board sizes (6â€“12). To run the game, install dependencies and launch simulator.py with the desired agent configurations.
