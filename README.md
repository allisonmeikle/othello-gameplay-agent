# McGill University, COMP 424
Developed a Reversi (Othello) AI agent for COMP 424 using Python, implementing strategic move selection in student_agent.py and testing performance against various opponents. The project includes a full simulation environment to visualize games, autoplay multiple matchups, and evaluate agents across dynamic board sizes (6â€“12). To run the game, install dependencies and launch simulator.py with the desired agent configurations.
